# Bamboo.SparkPostAdapter

An Adapter for the [Bamboo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bamboo) email app.

## Installation

The package can be installed as:

  1. Add bamboo_sparkpost to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:bamboo_sparkpost, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure bamboo is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:bamboo]]
        end

  3. Add the `Bamboo.TaskSupervisor` as a child to your supervisor. This is necessary for `deliver_later` to work.

        # Usually in lib/my_app_name.ex
        children = [
          # This is where you add the supervisor that handles deliver_later calls
          Bamboo.TaskSupervisorStrategy.child_spec
        ]

  4. Add your SparkPost API key to your config

        # In your config/config.exs file
        config :my_app, MyApp.Mailer,
          adapter: Bamboo.SparkPostAdapter
          api_key: "my-api-key"

  5. Follow Bamboo [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bamboo#getting-started)
